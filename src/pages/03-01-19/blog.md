## Moving Onwards
> Your speed doesn't matter, forward is forward.

It has been three weeks since we first started building our application, and we finally don't look like a 2005 HTML website! After countless lines of code and millions of commits, our group can finally see the finish line ahead.

But it wasn't always that easy...

## Making it Look Easy

And after three weeks of coding, there it was: our first big issue. No one likes their website looking like it came from the depths of 2005, and sadly that was the way our product looked. One page would have a completely different color scheme to another page, sometimes having no styling at all. 

I mean lets be honest, who would want to style their website manually when there are countless resources that make that process effortless? And that is how we came to meet `Material-UI`.

For those who don't know, Material-UI is what I would call a design language created by Google that emphasizes the use of grid layouts, and responsiveness. In essence, Material-UI is what thrusted our 2005 website into a sleek-looking, 2018-based product!

Individually, everyone in our group learned how to use Material-UI and then we took a divide and conquer approach to re-styling our web app. One person, one page. If you just use the basic Material-UI framework without customizing, it turns out that the color scheme stays consistent (and I'm definitely not complaining)! In a matter of a two or so days, our product was starting to not only be mobile-friendly, but as a side-effect, look more uniform.
